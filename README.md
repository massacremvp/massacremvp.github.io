# Yellow Tracker

Yellow Tracker is a discord bot to track MVPs.

Intructions:

1. Add the bot to your server through this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=417462153528737792&permissions=8192&scope=bot

2. Define a channel from server to be used exclusively for MVP tracking (OBS: is strongly recommeded that you use a new channel for this). This is done using the **!setmvpchannel** command. The bot in this channel will keep a list of tracked MVPs and their respective respawn times. Only users with highest role from server can use this command.
  - **WARNING**: After you use this command, **ALL** messages from channel (if there is any) will be erased and this will be irreversible!!! Be sure that you are choosing the right channel.

3. Use the **!track** commad to track a MVP that has been defeated. OBS.: can only be used inside MVP channel.

4. The bot also can be configured to speak the MVP nanme in a voice channel everytime a tracked MVP reachs the minimun respawn time. Use the **!setvoicechannel** command to define a voice channel that bot will enter and speak. OBS.: if you don't want the bot entering voice channel anymore, use the **!unsetvoicechannel** command.

5. In  addition to MVPs, the bot also can be used to track mining zones, where each zone represents one or more mining maps with characteristics in common (for instance, the mining zone "Ice Dungeon" corresponds to the "ice_dun01", "ice_dun02" and "ice_dun03" maps). As well as MVPs, you need to define a channel to be used exclusively to track mining zones. Use the **!setminingchannel** command. This channel will keep the list of tracked mining zones.
